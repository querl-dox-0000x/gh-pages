            Officer Davos of the Durham Police Department approached me while I trying to sleep around 3 am.  He asked my name, and I told him I would not be playing with him.  He asked me a few times, and after telling him that he did not need it, he instructed me that was impeding the investigation of a crime and that if I did not cooperate he would have to skip to "step 3", and arrest me under "John Doe".  I packed up sleeping bag and assumed the position.  He decided he didn't want to play anymore, and "sent me on my way".
