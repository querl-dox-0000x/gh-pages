            Visited Charlotte in 2005 for the Monday Night Packers vs Panthers, and though it was a good time and good game, sat in the worst seats, I have had for any game.  After the game, watched as one guy in a group of 10 was picking a fight with a homeless man who was asking for some food.  One in my group of 3 intervened luckily without incident, and gave the man the remains of pre-game tailgate feast..........
