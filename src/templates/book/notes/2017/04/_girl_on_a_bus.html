            She Reminded Me Of Someone I Used To Know.  I spoke to her, don't remember why, and she said she didn't speak English.  That is what I assume she said, because I didn't understand her, and she obviously didn't understand me.  We ended up boarding the same bus, with her sitting directly behind me.  The whole time on the bus, she voice chatting on her phone, using her native tongue.

            The bus driver made an announcement the bus was having problems and we would changing bus at the next stop (this I am sure was done for benefit).  Passengers were informed to take their carryons off the bus, and that their checked baggage would be transferred.  As everyone exited the bus, some laughed that girl had no idea what was going on, and some looked confused not knowing if she knew what was going on.

            Knowing she couldn't speak English, I tried my best to explaing to her what was going on.  I did my best to tell her she could follow me, because my ticket took me through her destination city.  She followed me into the terminal and sat next to me.  She made a call, and there were tears in her eyes.  I could tell she had no clue what was happening.  Eventually, pointed to her thinking if she could call someone,they could translate.  She had a better idea, and pulled the translation app.  After explaining what was going on, it was time to board the next bus.  I headed to the back hoping to find a seat that she could sit beside me if she wanted, but there were not two open together.  She ended up sitting diagnol from me.

            At the Texas/New Mexico border, there is an immigration checkpoint.  Since we had found a way to communicate, I was able to tell the girl to get her passport ready.  As border patrol came on the bus, they said "If you are not a US citizen, have your passport ready".  They went to the back, and made their way to the front, pointing a certain people, asking for ID.  They skipped over the girl, which I was glad because it made things easier on her, but they skipped over the one person on the whole bus that everyone knew was from another country (never figured out where, but she was most likely eastern European).  After they exited, I commented how that was the weirdest, immigration checkpoint I had ever seen.  After taking a second look at those who's ID they did check, I realized they were looking for "brown" people.

            At the next stop, the girl offered to buy me a refreshment.  I declined, which I would later regret, as I realize it was the only way she could show her gratitude.  As we boarded the next bus, she was walking behind me.  Not wanting to take a chance at the back of the bus, she grabbed me and pointed to the first open seat she saw.  That night, as we headed to her destination city, she breifly feel asleep, and ended up with her head on my shoulder.  Just as the girl I used to know did a couple times during rep meetings that got too boring.

            When we got to her destination city, there was not much that could be said.<br>
            I watched to make sure she got her bags.<br>
            I nodded at her.<br>
            She nodded at me.<br>
