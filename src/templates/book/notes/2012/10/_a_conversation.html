            Her friends tried to drag her away from a few times, and she didn't go.<br>
            Her friends tried to drag her away from a few times, and I assured them she was OK.<br>
            They wouldn't look at me.<br>

            Perhaps she approached me because I was the first approachable African American she saw.<br>
            Perhaps she approached me because she wanted to start a conflict.<br>
            Perhaps it was the first election she could actively take part in, and thought she could do what she saw the people on the cable news channel do.<br>
            Perhaps her friends knew what she was going to say, and didn't approve.<br>

            Forunately for me, my experiences have taught me that people only know what they have seen.<br>
            and<br>
            People who rationalize bad behavior, will find a way to accomplish thier evil deeds if that is thier intention.

            She informed me how Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.<br>
            She informed me how "you people", voted for him only because he was black, and that shouldn't be qualification for being president.<br>
            She informed me how Romney was going to get rid of welfare.<br>
            She informed me how "you people", were jealous of Romney because he had money, and I seemed to be doing OK for myself, so the others should be quiet and get out the ghetto, and they would be OK.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I informed her that Romney had "a plan to fix everthing", but would only say what it was after you voted for him and he was elected, and that in any other job he would be looked at as con man if said that.<br>
            I informed her that she made many assumptions about me based on my skin color, and most were probably wrong.<br>
            I informed her that I didn't have the same type of problems that everyone else had (and still don't), and I had no desire to force my logic and beliefs on anyone else.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I asked her, "If I told you I have the power to make you President, what would you do with it?"<br>
            Her response was that she would make it illegal for people to talk trash about candidates like they were doing to Romney on some channels.<br>
            I informed her that, I offered to make her one of the most powerful people in the world, and her first act was to take away freedom of speech.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We ended our conversation by me informing her that although she did not personally offend me, many people (regardless of race), would find many of the things she said hurtful.<br>
            She started to cry, and her boyfriend finally came and took her away.
