            After gun shots and screams of nigger outside of where I slept..................................................
        </p>
        <p>
            On a country road was circled by over 5 cars using the road and parking lot, called a nigger.
            <br> Taken to police station by tribal police.
            <br> Transported to hostpital by ambulance to hospital in Ukiah, CA for injuries suffered during the encounter.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Asked local Ukiah police to contact the FBI regarding situation.
            <br> Was told nobody was calling the FBI for me.
            <br> Since it is acceptable to intercept mobile calls including 911 calls what is a person to do?
